*The [expectations for all blog posts](../../blog-post-expectations.qmd) apply!* 

The Palmer Penguins data set is a data set collected by [Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the [Palmer Station](https://pal.lternet.edu/), Antarctica LTER, a member of the [Long Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/). It was first published by @gormanEcologicalSexualDimorphism2014 and was nicely packaged and released for use in the data science community by @horstAllisonhorstPalmerpenguinsV02020.  The data contains physiological measurements for a number of individuals from each of three species of penguin:

You can access the (training) data like this: 

```{python}
import pandas as pd

train_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/ml-notes/main/data/palmer-penguins/train.csv"
train = pd.read_csv(train_url)
```

Here's how the data looks: 

```{python}
train.head()
```

The "culmen" refers to a ridge on the bill of the penguin.

## Your Challenge

We are going to consider the problem of predicting the species of a penguin based on its measurements. 

1. **Explore**: Construct at least two interesting **displayed figure** (e.g. using [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)) and at least one interesting displayed summary table (e.g. using `pandas.groupby().aggregate`). Make sure to include a helpful discussion of both the figure and the table. Don't just show the result: explain what you learned about the data from these products. 
2. **Model**: Find *three features* of the data and a model trained on those features which achieves **100% testing accuracy**. You must obtain your three features through a **reproducible** process. That is, you can't just pick them: you need to code up some kind of search in order to obtain them. 
    - One feature must be qualitative (like `Island` or `Clutch Completion`). 
    - The other two features must be quantitative (like `Body Mass (g)` or `Culmen Depth (mm)`). 
3. **Evaluate**: Show the decision regions of your finished model, split out by the qualitative feature. 

I've supplied code to help you with several parts of this task. 




## Resources and Hints

### This Webpage Runs

If you run all the code on this assignment page in order, you'll produce the result at the bottom of the page (possibly after installing some more packages in your `ml-0451` Anaconda environment). So, one good way to approach this assignment is to take this code into a Jupyter notebook and start tweaking. 

### Data Preparation

You will need to prepare the qualitative columns in the data. Categorical feature columns like `Sex` and `Island` should be converted into so-called "one-hot encoded" 0-1 columns using the [`pd.get_dummies`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.get_dummies.html) function. The label column `Species` should be coded differently, using a `LabelEncoder`. The following function handles this work for you.  

```{python}
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
le = LabelEncoder()
le.fit(train["Species"])

def prepare_data(df):
  df = df.drop(["studyName", "Sample Number", "Individual ID", "Date Egg", "Comments", "Region"], axis = 1)
  df = df[df["Sex"] != "."]
  df = df.dropna()
  y = le.transform(df["Species"])
  df = df.drop(["Species"], axis = 1)
  df = pd.get_dummies(df)
  return df, y

X_train, y_train = prepare_data(train)
```

### Explore

Please create two interesting visualizations of the data, and one summary table (e.g. compute the average or median value of some features, by group). Your visualizations and table should:

1. Include axis labels and legends. 
2. Help you draw conclusions about what features you are going to try using for your model. 
3. Be accompanied by *discussion* of what you learned and how you will use it in modeling. Most figures and tables are worth at least one short paragraph of discussion. 

### Choosing Features

This is where much of the work for this blog post lies. You need to choose 3 good features! One possibility is to use some of the tools described on [this page](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_selection.html). Another approach, which is ok to use on this data set, is exhaustive search of all the features contained in the data set. For this, the `combinations` function from the `itertools` package might be helpful. 

**USE CROSS-VALIDATION**! This is your simplest way to guard against overfitting issues and get a good feeling for how your model might do on unseen data. 

[If you use the `Island` feature, you are allowed to use all of the columns that correspond to `Island`.]{.aside} 

```{python}

from itertools import combinations

# these are not actually all the columns: you'll 
# need to add any of the other ones you want to search for
all_qual_cols = ["Clutch Completion", "Sex"]
all_quant_cols = ['Culmen Length (mm)', 'Culmen Depth (mm)', 'Flipper Length (mm)']

for qual in all_qual_cols: 
  qual_cols = [col for col in X_train.columns if qual in col ]
  for pair in combinations(all_quant_cols, 2):
    cols = qual_cols + list(pair) 
    print(cols)
    # you could train models and score them here, keeping the list of 
    # columns for the model that has the best score. 
```

### Model Choices

There are three species of penguin in the data. Most classifiers in `scikit-learn` will handle multi-way classification without issue. For example: 

```{python}
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# this counts as 3 features because the two Clutch Completion 
# columns are transformations of a single original measurement. 
# you should find a way to automatically select some better columns
# as suggested in the code block above
cols = ["Flipper Length (mm)", "Body Mass (g)", "Clutch Completion_No", "Clutch Completion_Yes"]

LR = LogisticRegression()
LR.fit(X_train[cols], y_train)
LR.score(X_train[cols], y_train)
```

Even though `y_train` contains three categories (labeled `0`, `1`, and `2`), we're able to fit a `LogisticRegression()` no problem. 

Since `scikit-learn` makes it so easy to experiment, this blog post is a great opportunity to explore some out-of-the-box models. I'd suggest: 

- `from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier`. This one has a `max_depth` parameter that controls the complexity of the model. Use cross-validation to find a good value of the parameter. 
- `from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier`. State-of-the-art before the rise of neural networks. 
- `from sklearn.svm import SVC`. Another state-of-the-art algorithm before the rise of neural networks. Has a parameter `gamma` that controls the complexity of the model. Again, use cross-validation to select `gamma`. It's important to let `gamma` cover a wide range of values, e.g. `gamma = 10**np.arange(-5, 5)`. 

You can find a more thorough listing of models on [this page](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/classification/plot_classifier_comparison.html). 

### Testing

To test your model, you should download the test data set and prepare it using the `prepare_data` function. You'll need to make sure that you subset it using only the features you choose. Here's code that does this: 

```{python}
test_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/ml-notes/main/data/palmer-penguins/test.csv"
test = pd.read_csv(test_url)

X_test, y_test = prepare_data(test)
LR.score(X_test[cols], y_test)
```

### Plotting Decision Regions

Now we are going to plot a panel of decision regions for your classifier. You can use the `plot_regions` function defined below to plot your regions. **This function assumes that your first two columns in `X_train` are quantitative and that the columns after that are one-hot qualitative columns.**

```{python}
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```

```{python}

from matplotlib.patches import Patch

def plot_regions(model, X, y):
    
    x0 = X[X.columns[0]]
    x1 = X[X.columns[1]]
    qual_features = X.columns[2:]
    
    fig, axarr = plt.subplots(1, len(qual_features), figsize = (7, 3))

    # create a grid
    grid_x = np.linspace(x0.min(),x0.max(),501)
    grid_y = np.linspace(x1.min(),x1.max(),501)
    xx, yy = np.meshgrid(grid_x, grid_y)
    
    XX = xx.ravel()
    YY = yy.ravel()

    for i in range(len(qual_features)):
      XY = pd.DataFrame({
          X.columns[0] : XX,
          X.columns[1] : YY
      })

      for j in qual_features:
        XY[j] = 0

      XY[qual_features[i]] = 1

      p = model.predict(XY)
      p = p.reshape(xx.shape)
      
      
      # use contour plot to visualize the predictions
      axarr[i].contourf(xx, yy, p, cmap = "jet", alpha = 0.2, vmin = 0, vmax = 2)
      
      ix = X[qual_features[i]] == 1
      # plot the data
      axarr[i].scatter(x0[ix], x1[ix], c = y[ix], cmap = "jet", vmin = 0, vmax = 2)
      
      axarr[i].set(xlabel = X.columns[0], 
            ylabel  = X.columns[1], 
            title = qual_features[i])
      
      patches = []
      for color, spec in zip(["red", "green", "blue"], ["Adelie", "Chinstrap", "Gentoo"]):
        patches.append(Patch(color = color, label = spec))

      plt.legend(title = "Species", handles = patches, loc = "best")
      
      plt.tight_layout()
```

Here it is in action, visualized on the training data with a logistic regression classifier. For your blog post, I recommend visualizing decision regions on both the training and test sets, with the classifier of your choice. 
```{python}
plot_regions(LR, X_train[cols], y_train)
```

### Confusion Matrix

Please show a confusion matrix for your model, evaluated on the test set. Comment on the confusion matrix. Are certain types of errors more likely than others? 

## Explore!

Please feel encouraged to be creative in your choices of data visualization, predictive model, and algorithm to compute your features. I also like pictures of penguins. =)

## Abstract and Discussion

Please add an introductory "abstract" section to your blog post describing the high-level aims of of your analysis and an overview of your findings. The abstract should be no more than one paragraph. Then, add a closing "discussion" section of your blog post in which you summarize your findings and describe what you learned from the process of completing this post.

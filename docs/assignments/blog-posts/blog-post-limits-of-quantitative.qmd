### What You Should Do

Quantitative methods for assessing discrimination and bias include techniques like: 

- Formal (mathematical) definitions of bias and fairness in terms. 
- Audits of machine learning algorithms, including things like confusion matrices and false positive rates. 
- Statistical tests of significance for effects related to race, gender, or other protected attributes. 

In a recent speech, @narayanan2022limits [p. 25] asserts that 

> "currently quantitative methods are primarily used to justify the status quo. I would argue that they do more harm than good."

In a carefully-structured essay of approximately 1,500-2,000 words, engage this claim in conversation with the following scholarly sources: 

- Narayanan's speech.
- *Fairness and Machine Learning*: @barocasFairnessMachineLearning2023. 
- *Data Feminism*: @dignazioDataFeminism2023. 
- 3 additional scholarly sources of your choosing. 

Your essay should include: 

1. A careful explanation of Narayanan's position. 
2. A careful explanation of the *uses* or *benefits* of quantitative methods, as described in one of your scholarly sources. 
    - Please include at least one example of a beneficial study of an algorithm or decision-process using quantitative techniques. Include a careful discussion of which quantitative notion(s) of fairness or lack of discrimination was/were used in the example, in both the technical language of [Chapter 3](https://fairmlbook.org/classification.html) and the moral language of [Chapter 4](https://fairmlbook.org/relative.html) of  @barocasFairnessMachineLearning2023.  
3. A careful explanation of one of the *limitations* or *drawbacks* of quantitative methods, described in Narayanan's speech or one of your scholarly sources. 
    - Please include at least one example of a limited, misleading, or otherwise disappinting study of an algorithm or decision-process using quantitative techniques. Include a careful discussion of which quantitative notion(s) of fairness or lack of discrimination was/were used in the example, in both the technical language of [Chapter 3](https://fairmlbook.org/classification.html) and the moral language of [Chapter 4](https://fairmlbook.org/relative.html) of  @barocasFairnessMachineLearning2023.  
3. Appropriate supporting points from your other scholarly sources. 
4. An argument in which you stake out a position on Narayanan's claim of view. Do you agree? Disagree? Agree with qualifications? Which ones? Why? 

### References in Quarto

*Appropriately formatted citations are a fundamental aspect of scholarly writing. A fundamental aspect of **technical** scholarly writing is learning to manage references using automated tools such as Quarto. Managing references in Quarto is very easy once you have followed the setup below! Blog posts that do not use Quarto's citation system will receive at most Ms.* 

To manage references in Quarto, you need to create a `.bib` file (you can call it `refs.bib`). This file should live in the same directory as your blog post. Your `.bib` file is essentially a database of document information. Here's an example of a a `refs.bib` file: 

```bibtex
@book{hardtPatternsPredictionsActions2022,
  title = {Patterns, {{Predictions}}, and {{Actions}}},
  author = {Hardt, Moritz and Recht, Benjamin},
  year = {2022},
  publisher = {{Princeton University Press}},
  isbn = {978-0-691-23372-7},
  langid = {english}
}

@book{barocasFairnessMachineLearning2023,
  title = {Fairness and Machine Learning: Limitations and Opportunities},
  shorttitle = {Fairness and Machine Learning},
  author = {Barocas, Solon and Hardt, Moritz and Narayanan, Arvind},
  year = {2023},
  publisher = {{The MIT Press}},
  address = {{Cambridge, Massachusetts}}
}

@misc{narayanan2022limits,
  author       = {Narayanan, Arvind},
  howpublished = {Speech},
  title        = {The limits of the quantitative approach to discrimination},
  year         = {2022}
}
```

The simplest way to get entries for your references is to look them up on Google Scholar. 

1. Search for the document you want. 
2. Click the "Cite" link underneath and choose "Bibtex" from the options at the bottom. 
3. Copy and paste the contents of the new page to your `refs.bib` file. 

Once you've assembled your references, add the following line to your document metadata (the stuff in the top cell of your Jupyter notebook)

```yml
bibliography: refs.bib
```

Once you've followed these steps, you're ready to cite! You can reference your documents using the \@ symbol and their bibliographic key, which is the first entry for each document in the `refs.bib` file. For example, typing 

```
@barocasFairnessMachineLearning2023
```

results in the reference 

@barocasFairnessMachineLearning2023

as well as an entry in the "References" section at the end of your blog post, as illustrated below.

##### Special Focus: Disparity, Fairness, and Impact

Automated decision systems have a history reproducing structural privilege and oppression, especially in relation to race, gender, class, and sexuality. 

What does it mean for an automated decision system to be *fair*? This is a hard question which we will discuss from multiple perspectives.

#### [Collaborative]{.alert} Grading

:::


::: {.column .bg0}


###### **Initialization:** 

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}

- You set goals for your learning and achievement (in week 2).

:::

###### **Main Loop:**

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}

- You attend class, participate in activities, and complete assignments.  
- You get feedback on your assignments from me and the TAs, and you **revise**.

:::

###### **At End Of Course:**

::: {.incremental}

- You [**propose a letter grade**]{.alert} that reflects your learning and achievement, and discuss it with me. 

:::

###### [The feedback you get on individual assignments is *data for your proposal*. There is no formula.]{.fragment}

:::




## {.bg1 .smaller}

### Collaborative Grading

<br> <br> 

|  | [Opportunity]{.alert} | [*Challenge*]{.alert-3} | 
|---------|:-----|:------|
| No points,  no averages      | You can focus on **feedback** and **set your own goals**.   |    *You need to motivate based on your interest in the class* |
| Resubmit assignments      | One of the **best ways to learn**   | *Need to read feedback and prioritize time for revisions* |
| Can skip assignments     | No busy work -- work on what's valuable **to you**.  | *Still need to work enough to learn and meet your goals* |
| No hard due-dates       | Don't ask for extensions, take the time you need   |  *Need to keep yourself on pace to achieve your goals*  |
: {tbl-colwidths="[20,37,37]"}

## {.split-50}

::: {.column .bg1}

#### What a Grade Sounds Like... 

[**A**]{.alert}: *I am ready to take the theory, techniques, and ideas of this course into my endeavours outside this classroom: future classes, projects, hobbies, career.*

[**B**]{.alert}: *With help or review, I might be able to take some of what I learned outside this classroom.*

[**C**]{.alert}: *I showed up and did stuff, but I don't really see any ways to take what I learned outside this classroom.*

[**D-F**]{.alert}: *I didn't really show up or do much.*

:::

::: {.column .bg0}
<!-- #### Work Expected [Work Expected]{.hide} -->

I am very likely to accept your proposed grade in the course if you EITHER: 

- Complete **most assignments** to a high standard (including revisions) OR
- Work for **~10 productive hours per week** outside of class OR
- Do some of the assignments I give you and also **some other things** (that you propose) that are relevant to the course learning goals.

#### What is something that makes you feel [nervous]{.alert-4} or [confused]{.alert-4} about collaborative grading?  


## {.bg1}

### The Wisdom Of Those Who Have Gone Before

*[Stay on top of the blog posts and do the daily warmups]{.alert}. also go to office hours if you are confused, Phil is helpful and there will likely be CS0451 peers there to talk through assignments with.*

*[Review after each class]{.alert} using lecture notes so that you have a solid understanding of the concepts taught in class.*

*get to know quarto blogs and [watch threeblueonebrown essence of linear algebra]{.alert} on Youtube to review some ideas*

*Be realistic in your goal setting and [focus on what you want to get out of the course]{.alert}.*

*[Focus on learning and growing]{.alert} instead of the grade. Be curious and think hard.*

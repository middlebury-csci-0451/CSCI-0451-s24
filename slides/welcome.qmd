##### What's In This Course

Short answer: stuff that is harder to learn from the internet. 



[![](../assets/img/screencaps/mosh.png)]{.fragment}

::: {.fragment}

```python
LR = LogisticRegression()
LR.fit(predictors, target)
LR.predict(new_predictors)
```

[*We are going to learn this workflow in a day, then do more interesting things*.]{.fragment}



:::

::: {.fragment}

##### Special Focus: Disparity, Fairness, and Impact

*Algorithmic bias* is the tendency of automated systems to reproduce structural privilege and oppression, especially in relation to race, gender, and sexuality. 

Most systems that impact people in any way have at least a risk of algorithmic bias. Active mitigation is usually needed.

#### [Collaborative]{.alert} Grading

:::


::: {.column .bg0}


###### **Initialization:** 

::: {.incremental}

- You set goals for your learning and achievement (in week 2).

:::

###### **Main Loop:**

::: {.incremental}

- You attend class, participate in activities, and complete assignments.  
- You get feedback on your assignments from me and the TAs, and you **revise**.
- You reflect on your learning and achievement at different points throughout the course. 

:::

###### **At End Of Course:**

::: {.incremental}

- You [**propose a letter grade**]{.alert} that reflects your learning and achievement, and discuss it with me. 

:::

###### [The feedback you get on individual assignments is *data for your proposal*. There is no formula.]{.fragment}

## {.bg1 .smaller}

### Collaborative Grading

<br> <br> 

|  | [Opportunity]{.alert} | [*Challenge*]{.alert-3} | 
|---------|:-----|:------|
| No points,  no averages      | You can focus on **feedback** and **set your own goals**.   |    *You need to motivate based on your interest in the class* |
| Resubmit assignments      | One of the **best ways to learn**   | *Need to read feedback and prioritize time for revisions* |
| Can skip assignments     | No busy work -- work on what's valuable **to you**.  | *Still need to work enough to learn and meet your goals* |
| No hard due-dates       | Don't ask for extensions, take the time you need   |  *Need to keep yourself on pace to achieve your goals*  |
: {tbl-colwidths="[20,37,37]"}

## {.split-50}

::: {.column .bg1}

#### What a Grade Sounds Like... 

[**A**]{.alert}: *I am ready to take the theory, techniques, and ideas of this course into my endeavours outside this classroom: future classes, projects, hobbies, career.*

[**B**]{.alert}: *With help or review, I might be able to take some of what I learned outside this classroom.*

[**C**]{.alert}: *I showed up and did stuff, but I don't really see any ways to take what I learned outside this classroom.*

[**D-F**]{.alert}: *I didn't really show up or do much.*

:::

::: {.column .bg0}
#### Work Expected [Work Expected]{.hide}

I am very likely to accept your proposed grade in the course if you EITHER: 

- Complete **most assignments** to a high standard (including revisions) OR
- Work for **~10 productive hours per week** outside of class OR
- Do some of the assignments I give you and also **some other things** (that you propose) that are relevant to the course learning goals.

### What I [expect]{.alert} from you now 

## {.split-50}

::: {.column .bg1}

#### CS Stuff

You can write moderately-complex, [object-oriented software]{.alert}. 

You are comfortable reading [software documentation]{.alert} and [researching]{.alert} how to perform a task that you haven't seen before.

You have experience [debugging]{.alert} your code and you are ready to do it a lot more. 

:::

::: {.column .bg0}

#### Math Stuff

You remember most of MATH 0200 and CSCI 0200: 

- Matrix multiplication and inner products
- $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$.  
- Visualizing linear and affine spaces. 
- Eigenvalues, eigenvectors, positive-definite matrices. 
- Derivatives, critical points of functions. 
- Sample spaces, probability distribution functions, random variables.
- Conditional probability and expectations. 

You are ready to [look up]{.alert-2} what you don't remember.

<!-- 
## {.split-50}

::: {.column .bg1}

#### Linear Algebra

- Matrix multiplication. 
- Inner products: $$\langle \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \rangle = \mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{y} \triangleq \sum_{i = 1}^{p} x_i y_i\;. $$ 
- Norms: $\lVert \mathbf{x} \rVert_2^2 \triangleq \langle \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x} \rangle\;.$
- Everything about $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$.  
- Eigenvalues, eigenvectors, positive-definite matrices. 
- Matrix inverses. 
- Visualizing low-dimensional linear and affine spaces. 
- [Doing it in Python with numpy]{.alert} (we will learn along the way). 

::: 

::: {.column .bg0}

#### Other Math 

###### **Probability** (from CSCI 0200)
- Sample spaces, probability distribution functions. 
- Conditional probability. 
- Random variables, mean and variance. 
- (Conditional) expectation. 

###### **Calculus** 

- Fearless differentiation. 
- Critical points of functions when $f'(x) = 0$.
